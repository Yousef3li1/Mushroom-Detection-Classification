# 🍄 Mushroom Detection & Classification  

## 📌 Overview  
The **Mushroom Detection & Classification** project is a **machine learning-based application** designed to **detect and classify different types of mushrooms**. Using **computer vision and deep learning**, the model can determine whether a mushroom is **edible or poisonous** based on its physical characteristics.  

This project leverages **YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection** and **deep learning models** to perform real-time detection and classification of mushrooms from images or videos.
